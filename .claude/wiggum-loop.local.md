Implement the manual play monitor according to plans/manual-play-monitor.md. Complete Phase 1 (modify manual_play.py for read-only monitoring with action space display). The monitor should launch --visual-cli mode, read stdout, request and display valid actions, and pretty-print observations. Use existing code from current manual_play.py where applicable.
