# HackMatrix Colab Notebooks

## Quick Start: Train on TPU (Free!)

Click here to open the training notebook in Google Colab:

**[Open in Colab →](https://colab.research.google.com/github/charleseff/hack-matrix/blob/main/python/notebooks/train_hackmatrix_tpu.ipynb)**

### What you'll get:
- 🚀 Free TPU access (8 cores, v2 or v3)
- ⚡ 50-100x faster than CPU training
- 📊 Train 10M timesteps in ~5-10 minutes
- 💾 Download trained checkpoints

### Before running:
1. Click the link above
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → **TPU**
3. Run cells in order

See [COLAB_QUICKSTART.md](../docs/COLAB_QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions.
